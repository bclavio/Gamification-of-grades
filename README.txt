EVERYTHING NEEDED TO RUN THE PROGRAM IS FOUND IN THIS FOLDER!

1. To run the program, open /Prototype/index.html and run the code in your favourite browser. 
(We do recommend, however, not to use Firefox since we experienced some trouble with this particular browser)

2. The program is set to "offline mode", which means it runs independent of the server, and a user ID will therefore not be required. 

3. The program is set to always enter state 3, i.e. the feedback page, and NOT state 4, which only presents a grade.

4. When in state 2, i.e. the test page, a short-cut has been implemented in the uppermost left corner. By clicking within the corner, 
the program will go directly to the feedback page, without having to wait for the timer to reach 00:00.
